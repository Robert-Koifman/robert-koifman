Hello! Thank you for visiting my profile. My name is Robert Koifman. I specialize in IoT and communication technologies. If you're an IoT developer, I'm sure weâ€™ll have a lot to share with each other. For the last few years, Iâ€™ve been developing a project called [Softnet Free](https://github.com/softnet-free). This is a platform that provides TCP/IP-enabled devices with a medium for remote communication over the Internet. The platform is freely available under the Apache 2.0 license. If you are a DIY developer, you can utilize it to build fully functional Internet-enabled IoT projects. If you are a startup planning to create some kind of IoT product that involves Internet communication, Softnet Free can help you save a lot of costs and speed up the implementation of your business idea. And if you're a device manufacturer, you can consider the prospect of utilizing this platform for your products. Visit the project's [home page](https://github.com/softnet-free) to learn more about Softnet Free. "[The concept of Softnet Free](https://github.com/orgs/Softnet-Free/discussions/2)" explores the platform in detail. What I want from you is your comments, offers and contributions. You are welcome to [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Softnet-Free/discussions), where you can ask questions, explore examples, etc.
